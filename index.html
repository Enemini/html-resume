                <h2>Profile </h2>
                <p>I have been working in IT for the past 4years: first as a network engineer, then as an IT support
                    specialist, and finally delving into cloud computing where I find the most fulfillment. Being a
                    cloud engineer is fascinating as I get to interact with several tools such Terraform, Docker,
                    Kubernetes, Jenkins, Prometus etc to deliver on the job.</p>
